&lt;div class=&#34;info info&#34; data-title=&#34;Work In Progress&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still in the middle of writing this article, and I probably will be always updating this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just recently (re)installed Linux on my Acer V5 122p. Had to fiddle around with UEFI settings thinking to preserve my Windows 8.1 partition, but eventually I had to bite the bullet. I wiped the whole partition clean and turned off UEFI so my installation would be a lot simpler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up installing PeppermintOS which is a very lightweight distribution. After installing a few updates, the system was snappy and fast. I started to install the usual apps and configuration I normally use, when I realized I don&amp;rsquo;t have a document to use as a reference. I&amp;rsquo;ve been mostly doing stuff through memory and through Googling as soon as I encounter the problem or need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the blogpost to rectify that, as well as give you a glimpse as to how I like my machine setup and configured :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Setup natural scrolling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I got my Macbook Air 2010 upgraded to Lion, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fan of what Apple called &amp;ldquo;natural scrolling.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andybarratt.co.uk/lion-like-scrolling-on-ubuntu-inverse-scrolling-on-linux&#34;&gt;http://www.andybarratt.co.uk/lion-like-scrolling-on-ubuntu-inverse-scrolling-on-linux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Setup Sublime Text&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I should start learning Emacs, but Sublime Text (and before that, Textmate) had always been my editor of choice. That might change in the near future though :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.webupd8.org/20&#34;&gt;Ubuntu PPA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Sublime Text settings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sublime.wbond.net/installation&#34;&gt;Package control&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Key management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I keep my private key in Dropbox. I know many people would say that this is a security risk (and it is) but the keys that I do keep in Dropbox are only those with access to non-critical remote systems that I own. I run some rtorrent download boxes as well as some application servers that I use for quickly testing out application ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reinstalling Kubuntu</title>
      <link>http://life.beyondrails.com/blog/2006/03/19/reinstalling-kubuntu/</link>

      <guid>http://life.beyondrails.com/blog/2006/03/19/reinstalling-kubuntu/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My data drive had some corruption as regards its file system tree, and i was forced to rebuild it. I figured I&amp;rsquo;ll just reinstall Kubuntu too since I inadverdently installed Ubuntu Desktop, which kinda doubled the applications I have on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the things I did in order to remind myself in case my system crashes again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a dos partition writable - the options in fstab for the partition should be: user,exec,rw,umask=000 0 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get Automatix and install some of the necessary non-free software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install packages used for compiling source code: sudo apt-get install build-essential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll add to the list as I walk through the rebuilding of my settings.&lt;/p&gt;
