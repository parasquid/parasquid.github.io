      <title>Preparing for a Hackathon: Choosing Your Platform</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best things you can do during your hackathon presentation is to have your hack available on a publicly accessible platform. You can definitely just host your app in your local machine for the demo, but it is more powerful and impressive if you can involve everyone else in a room and get them to play with  your hack during your demo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I&amp;rsquo;m a Ruby developer and my framework of choice during hackathons is Ruby on Rails, so my suggestions here would be biased accordingly. YMMV&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part two of a three part series I&amp;rsquo;m making on hackathons. &lt;a href=&#34;http://life.beyondrails.com/blog/2015/06/26/preparing-for-a-hackathon/&#34;&gt;Check out Part 1&lt;/a&gt; if you haven&amp;rsquo;t read it yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I once posted an answer to one of my friend&amp;rsquo;s question: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/parasquid/posts/10153434511932922&#34;&gt;Guys, how to win hackathon&lt;/a&gt; and I thought I should expand more about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve attended and won (or at least went into the finals) a number of hackathons. The latest one I&amp;rsquo;ve attended was AngelHack KL and although we didn&amp;rsquo;t win the first prize, we were told that we were so close to winning the hack. We&amp;rsquo;ve also received a lot of feedback from the judges, sponsors, and acquaintances to bring the product to market and make it a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/1gLo2L8&#34;&gt;We did of course&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; when you have government officials and technology leaders all asking you to bring a product to market, that&amp;rsquo;s a good sign &amp;ndash; and I think it&amp;rsquo;s going to be an interesting next few months :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, there are two ingredients to the &lt;em&gt;secret sauce&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There must be a valid problem to solve. A very specific, but otherwise a valid problem. The one we were trying to solve in ‪#‎ahkl2015‬ was: I work with this girl, and her birthday is coming up, and I got invited to her birthday. What should I give her? (true story btw)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a magic &lt;em&gt;twist&lt;/em&gt;. Hackathons are all about innovation. Back in 2011, cab hailing apps were none to be found and if you made one, you&amp;rsquo;d probably win. Not now because the space is very much crowded, and the &amp;ldquo;twist&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t so magical anymore (using your phone&amp;rsquo;s GPS to show the other cabs around, and show your cab where you want to be picked up).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first ingredient is quite &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; to figure out. You&amp;rsquo;ll definitely have an abundance of small personal issues you&amp;rsquo;d love to be solved. You just need to have a brainstorm with some of your friends and focus your idea into something that&amp;rsquo;s polished and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second ingredient is a bit more complicated since you really need that special idea to transform a boring solution into a magical one. I suggest looking at the theme and the sponsors and see how their offerings will helpgive that additional kick to your solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our team, we initially started with just sending the recipient of the gift a survey, but we made the twist magical by making a damn-smart-machine-learning-algorithm to figure out the recipient&amp;rsquo;s personality and suggest a gift for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackathons are not just all about technical chops. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen teams that have devs waaaay better than our team. There are devs 100x even better, but they probably are sleeping on the weekend and not participating. Having enough tech skills to pull off making a product is a given; that&amp;rsquo;s why you have to compete on the creativity of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a lot of management skills required in a hackathon. You&amp;rsquo;ll initially have a grand idea of what to build, but eventually you&amp;rsquo;ll realize that you don&amp;rsquo;t have time to implement them all. You will need to re-scope, and re-prioritize all the time (yes, even in the last hour). You will have to cut off a functionality you thought was critical, but since you can&amp;rsquo;t implement it on time you will have to work around it. You will never ship a perfect product, but one that you can live with and you can pitch with.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recommended Programs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While mucking around my computer and generally getting bored, I found a few neat programs to install. They&amp;rsquo;re really cool, and your Linux computer shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be without them :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://adblock.mozdev.org/&#34;&gt;Firefox AdBlocker&lt;/a&gt; - blocks ads from websites. Definitely heaven sent, as browsing becomes faster without all those ads being loaded (the extension dynamically modifies the page to comment out the ads, so they don&amp;rsquo;t get rendered). You can get to choose which ones to block too. Get the AdBlocker and teach those popup advertisers a lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://yakuake.uv.ro/&#34;&gt;Yakuake&lt;/a&gt; - cool konsole for KDE. Anyone who had played quake before would recognize the interface. No need to reserve a space for the taskbar entry in the main panel. Plus, a terminal emulator is just one keypress away :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://packages.debian.org/stable/games/kworldclock&#34;&gt;kde WorldClock&lt;/a&gt; - nice way to impress your friends by showing you are a &amp;ldquo;Citizen of the World.&amp;rdquo; Set this as your desktop background and you&amp;rsquo;ll immediately know if it&amp;rsquo;s day or night in a particular region of the Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
